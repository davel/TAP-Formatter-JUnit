Revision history for Perl extension TAP::Formatter::JUnit.

0.02
    - POD updates
    - minor cleanup to the test names output in JUnit
    - attempt to fix failing CPAN Tester reports, where an older version of
      'prove' was being picked up by t/formatter.t; provide our own
      't/bin/my-prove' and use that instead.

0.01    Wed Jan  7 22:06 PST 2009
    - initial version
    - had this sitting around on my HD for several months and am (finally)
      getting around to uploading it to CPAN
